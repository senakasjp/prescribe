# Security Documentation

## üîí Overview

The Patient Management System implements comprehensive security measures to ensure patient data privacy and HIPAA compliance. The system uses Firebase Firestore for secure cloud storage with strict doctor data isolation.

## üõ°Ô∏è Doctor Data Isolation

### Critical Security Implementation

**Each doctor can ONLY see their own patients.** This is a fundamental security requirement that prevents cross-doctor data access and ensures HIPAA compliance.

### Implementation Details

#### Secure Patient Queries
```javascript
// ‚úÖ SECURE: All patient queries require doctor ID
async getPatients(doctorId) {
  if (!doctorId) {
    throw new Error('Doctor ID is required to access patients')
  }
  
  const q = query(
    collection(db, this.collections.patients), 
    where('doctorId', '==', doctorId)  // üîí SECURITY FILTER
  )
}
```

#### Secure Patient Creation
```javascript
// ‚úÖ SECURE: Patient creation requires doctor ID
async createPatient(patientData) {
  const patient = {
    ...patientData,
    doctorId: patientData.doctorId  // üîí REQUIRED FIELD
  }
}
```

### Security Validation

- **Required Doctor ID** - All patient operations require valid doctor ID
- **Firebase Rules** - Server-side security rules enforce data isolation
- **Query Filtering** - All queries automatically filter by doctor ID
- **No Cross-Access** - Impossible to access other doctors' patients

## üîê Authentication & Authorization

### User Roles

#### Doctor
- **Access Level**: Can only access their own patients
- **Permissions**: Full CRUD operations on their patients
- **Data Scope**: Limited to patients with matching `doctorId`

#### Super Admin (`senakahks@gmail.com`)
- **Access Level**: System-wide access with admin privileges
- **Permissions**: Can view all doctors and delete doctor accounts
- **Data Scope**: Access to admin panel and system statistics
- **Protection**: Cannot be deleted by anyone

#### Pharmacist
- **Access Level**: Can view prescriptions from connected doctors
- **Permissions**: Read-only access to shared prescriptions
- **Data Scope**: Limited to prescriptions shared by connected doctors

### Authentication Flow

1. **User Login** - Secure authentication via Firebase Auth
2. **Role Assignment** - System assigns appropriate role and permissions
3. **Data Access** - User can only access data within their role scope
4. **Session Management** - Secure session handling with proper logout

## üè• HIPAA Compliance

### Patient Data Protection

- **Data Isolation** - Each doctor's patients are completely isolated
- **Access Control** - Strict role-based access control
- **Audit Trail** - All data operations are logged
- **Data Encryption** - All data encrypted in transit and at rest

### Privacy Safeguards

- **Minimum Necessary** - Users only see data they need for their role
- **Data Integrity** - Validation prevents data corruption
- **Secure Storage** - Firebase provides enterprise-grade security
- **Access Logging** - All access attempts are logged

## üîß Technical Security Measures

### Firebase Security

#### Firestore Security Rules
```javascript
// Example security rules (server-side)
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Patients can only be accessed by their doctor
    match /patients/{patientId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null 
        && resource.data.doctorId == request.auth.uid;
    }
    
    // Doctors can only access their own data
    match /doctors/{doctorId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null 
        && request.auth.uid == doctorId;
    }
  }
}
```

### Data Validation

#### Input Sanitization
- **Required Fields** - Only `firstName` and `age` are mandatory for patients
- **Data Types** - Proper type checking and conversion
- **Data Cleanup** - Remove corrupted or invalid entries
- **Serialization** - Proper data serialization for Firebase

#### Error Handling
- **Comprehensive Logging** - All errors logged with context
- **Graceful Degradation** - System continues to function on errors
- **User Feedback** - Clear error messages for users
- **Security Logging** - Security-related events are logged

## üö® Security Incident Response

### Data Breach Prevention

- **Access Monitoring** - Monitor all data access attempts
- **Anomaly Detection** - Detect unusual access patterns
- **Regular Audits** - Periodic security audits
- **User Training** - Security awareness for users

### Incident Response Plan

1. **Detection** - Identify security incidents quickly
2. **Containment** - Isolate affected systems
3. **Investigation** - Determine scope and impact
4. **Recovery** - Restore normal operations
5. **Lessons Learned** - Improve security measures

## üîç Security Monitoring

### Access Logging

- **User Actions** - Log all user actions and data access
- **Authentication Events** - Track login/logout events
- **Data Modifications** - Log all data changes
- **Error Events** - Track security-related errors

### Monitoring Tools

- **Firebase Analytics** - Built-in Firebase monitoring
- **Custom Logging** - Application-specific security logs
- **Error Tracking** - Comprehensive error monitoring
- **Performance Monitoring** - Track system performance
