## Styling Details

### CSS Classes Used
- **Container**: `mt-4` - Adds top margin for spacing
- **Label**: `block text-sm font-medium text-gray-700 mb-2` - Standard label styling
- **Textarea**: `w-full px-3 py-2 border border-gray-300 rounded-lg text-sm placeholder-gray-500 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-teal-500 focus:border-teal-500` - Full-width textarea with consistent styling

### 2. Data Binding
- `prescriptionNotes` is passed between `PatientDetails.svelte` and `PrescriptionsTab.svelte`
- Two-way binding ensures data synchronization

### 3. Data Persistence
- Notes are saved with prescription data
- Available across sessions and page refreshes

### 4. PDF Generation
- Notes are automatically included in prescription PDF generation
- Displayed at the bottom of the prescription document
