I need a patient management system to implement based on Svelte and firebase.
A doctor can register for the system
One doctor has one or meny patients
A doctor see only the patients he added
A patient have one or more illness
A patient can be be prescribed with one or more prescriptions
A prescription has one or more drugs (medicines)
A patient has a symptoms, ilnesses, tests and prescription hostory
Doctor and register/select a patient
Under patient symptoms and prescriptions can be entered
To indentify new prescripiton just consider click "+ New Prescripton" as a start of new prescription
Prescription can be printed as PDF 

Make another account type pharmacist.
Pharmacist should login to the system separately
It has a email add and business name
When create the account, a unique 6 digit number is generated
Doctors can add pharmacist using the number give
When doctor send a prescription pharmacist can view it
