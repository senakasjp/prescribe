# Legacy Documentation Archive

These documents were moved from repository root to reduce maintenance overhead.

Canonical docs are now:
- `README.md`
- `DOCS.md`
- `PRODUCT_MANUAL.md`
- `ENGINEERING_MANUAL.md`
- `TESTING_GUIDE.md`
- `CHANGELOG.md`

Use legacy docs only for historical context. If conflicts exist, canonical docs are source of truth.
